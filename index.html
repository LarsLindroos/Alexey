<b style ="font-family:georgia;"> The Process</b>
	
<pre>
<p style ="font-family:georgia;">
	
We had a couple of jobs to fill in to make this work. Some roles were being a Writing manager, a Code manager, 
and a Sources Manager. My role was writing, I reviewed all writing and came up with a possible solution that is 
approbated by all. A couple of critics thought that my writing was too impertinent, so I decided to make a specific 
page milder when it comes to the aggressivity of the message (it’s supposed to be a book review…). Nevertheless, I 
“crunched” through to make the message(s) more direct.

Lars had various coding ideas via HTML, meaning that he is the one who came up with the template for the website. 
When Github was rejecting our smacking of our trackpads, Lars would be the one to find a way to make Github work. 
In the beginning, when we were working on our website on a random compiler, Lars had some experience with a fascinating 
website called Github. “This website makes publishing HTML creations easy. And it’s free.” Lars said. 

Lars always had a solution to a problem with regards to our use of Github. To get into detail, the
compiler we used for the first version of our website was Tutorialspoint.com. The very same website 
soon helped us implement the new bar menu that was more visually pleasing according to our Source manager. 
To indicate that the user was on a specific page we used W3.CSS code to make the black buttons white, this 
gives visual information to the user helping the feeling of cleanness throughout the entire experience. 
(Here’s the old code for the website: Just paste the code into the Tutorialspoint.com compiler site to 
see the old version)

The Source manager, Sophia, worked on the bibliography and examining a couple of books to participate in 
giving accurate information about Alexey Petrovich Maresyev’s certain human will. Citing, listening, translating, 
processing, various documents/books (The Story of a Real Man by Boris Polevoi and other insightful websites), and 
documentaries on his journey across the snowy forest (biography page has more information on his experience).

This man is without a doubt, an unsung hero. He actively didn’t want to be acknowledged because he felt certain he 
wasn’t supposed to be a legend (Alexey Maresyev’s humble behavior: person). Either Maresyev’s story has become obsolete at 
the current moment, or it is popular outside of the US (Russia). He was very popular with historians around the 1940’s, less 
with the general public, it’s possible that historians lost interest in Maresyev.

Maresyev’s story is very essential when it comes to heroic figures.

The interesting primary source we used was The Story of a Real Man by Boris Polevoi.

Thesis Statement: What Makes a Man a Hero?
</b></pre>
<pre>
<p style ="font-family:georgia;">

Heroes can have be just as impactful as a hero in providing morale for a people lacking in hope, or 
faith in their own country, as more classic heroes, known best for their help in saving the lives of others. 
Often, people consider soldiers (like Alexey) much lesser heroes than that of the “Schindler” sort; this isn’t 
necessarily true. According to Merriam-Webster, a hero is defined as such: “A person admired for achievements 
and noble qualities” and “One who shows great courage”. Russia, and its people, were in a great time of need during 
the period of time surrounding WW2; according to bbc, many of the people there lived in fear of their corrupt 
government, and got along on very poor living conditions. In an article by bbc, Kazimiera Pawlinska, a woman who lived 
in Russia during 1940, gave her story. At one point, she said “Looking at the life we led in retrospect, the society 
was constantly afraid and profoundly corrupt”. Soldiers like Alexey represented a powerful, heroic entity aside from 
their corrupt government. Thanks to his books and immense news coverage (within Russia), Alexey Maresyev inspired many 
people throughout his homeland, and helped to restore even a small fraction of their faith in their own country.
